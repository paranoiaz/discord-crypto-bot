# Discord Crypto Bot
An easy to use and simple to configure bot to track cryptocurrency with. Currently only supports Bitcoin and Ethereum but more cryptocurrencies might be added in the future.

**Dependencies**
```
discord.py
asyncio
aiohttp
datetime
bs4
```

**Setup**

Create a Discord bot using their developer tools and paste the token into the config.py file. Here you can also edit the bot's command prefix and the cooldown on some commands. You should not edit the settings.txt file as this is done using the bot's commands. Run bot.py and use the help command to see all the commands and their parameters.
