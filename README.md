# Discord CryptoBot
A simple to use and easy to configure bot to track cryptocurrency. Currently only supports Bitcoin and Ethereum but more cryptocurrencies might be added in the future.

**Dependencies**
```
Python 3.7+
discord.py
asyncio
aiohttp
datetime
```

**Setup**

Create a Discord bot using their dev tools and paste the token into the config.py file. Here you can also edit the bot's command prefix and the cooldown on some commands. You should not edit the settings.txt file as this is done using the bot's commands. Run bot.py and use the help command to see all the commands and their parameters.
